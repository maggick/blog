# Cryptography

The cryptography is the art of cypher an informations to hide it from unwanted people.

## RSA

In this school project we have to recode the
[RSA algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29)in C with the
[GMPlibrary](http://gmplib.org).
You can found the source code on [gitHub](https://github.com/maggick/rsa).

## Vigenere Cryptanalysis

In this school project we must code a [Vigenere
cryptanalysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Cryptanalysis)
algorithm.
You can found the source code on [GitHub]
(https://github.com/maggick/Vigenere-Cryptanalysis").
