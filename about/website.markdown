# About This Website

I have no more domain to put my website on.

This was my newest version of my website published the 5 November 2012. 
It was [HTML5 valid](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.matthieu-keller.info%2F).
The CSS validation was in progress.

## History

This is the fourth version of this website :

* The first version was an home made website. Entirely write in HTML, CSS and PHP. It was a great exercise 
  to learn the base of web 3-tier architecture with a client, a server and a database.
* The second version was powered by Word Press. In fact this was a classic WP with a plug-in for 
  multi-languages and some simple changes in the default pages style.
* The third was generated using Middleman, a static site generator in Ruby wich
  generate HTML pages from markdown files.

With the Word Press version I always have to use the online interface to create or update articles and pages.
Moreover the data were on the site database, meaning that as I do not save them, they were not backuped as 
my usual data.
With this version, I write pages in [Markdown format](https://github.com/github/markup#readme) 
directly on my computer with my favorite text editor, commit them on GitHub and finally put them on the server.
There is no more database (meaning no more commentary, see the [About Me section](/about/me/#contact) for contact).
The site is entirely static.

## Technically

This website is generating using the bash command `markdown` and directly puting
the HTML output file into my website directory.
