Today I start my blog using Pelican and hosting it with github pages.
It is located at [www.matthieukeller.com/blog](http://www.matthieukeller.com/blog).
On [www.matthieukeller.com](http://www.matthieukeller.com) you will find a sort
of portal where I redirect travelers to this blog or to my notes located at
[www.mattieukeller.com/notes](http://www.matthieukeller.com/notes). My notes are is
the place where is store my "how to" and the things that may help other peoples,
they are also hosted with github pages.

Nevertheless all this notes and all the content of this blog is redacted locally
with vim and then push to github. That means that I have all traces of every
article and every notes redacted here.

I want to offer a comments solution where
all the comments are stored on my computer but I am not sure it is possible and
I will probably use discuss in a first time.

The default theme of pelican is awful and I will change it in the next few days.
Hoping that I found one better.

_Edit:_

29 Oct. 2014: I use discuss for the comments and I use the maggner for pelican
theme. You can read more about the theme in the
[blog changes](http://www.matthieukeller.com/blog/2014/10/27/blog-changes.html)
article.
