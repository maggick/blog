There was a lot of changes lately on the blog. I rewrite the urls, I moved the
notes section, I displayed the categories in the menu, add a favicon and add a
markdown plugin.

I wrote more "about" pages, separating the "about me" and "about website" pages and
creating a sports pages with my time for each race I run.

I also tweak the theme by adding icons, adding borders around code blocs,
putting the same CSS to pages as to articles and some minors improvements.

# Site changes

## URLs

First of all I moved the blog from www.matthieukeller.com/blog to
www.matthieukeller.com and then to matthieukeller.com. The first change allow
me to delete the ugly and useless portal page. The second one allow me to move
from the 90's.

Moreover I correct some of my configuration which lead to 404 pages when using
author and category links inside an article.

## Notes

There was two part of the website, the /blog and the /notes.
First of all I moved the about pages which where located in the notes section
and put it as a [static page in the /blog](/pages/about.html) part and then I
moved all the notes into [a notes page](/pages/notes.html).

## Error page

I remove the 404 page from github to put my own with a link to the
[archives](/archives.html) and to the [notes](/pages/notes.html).

## Categories

I Display the category in the menu. A theme change was needed as the original
one does not handle them.

## Plugin

 * I use the
   [Summary pelican plugin](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/summary)
   in order to control the summary size.

 * I use the
   [toc markdwon plugin](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/extensions/toc.html)
   in order to make a simple table of content.

 * I use [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytic) in order to track
   the number of visitor (you can disable javascript if you do not want to be
   tracked).

## Favicon

I add a favicon to the website.

## About pages

I separate the [about page](/pages/about.html) from the
[about website pages](/pages/about-this-website.html) and wrote a [sport
page](pages/palmares.html) with my personal records for races and a link to the
[Strava](http://strava.com) gps trace.

# Theme tweaking

It tweak the [maggner pelican theme](https://github.com/kplaube/maggner-pelican)
a lot and [my repository](https://github.com/maggick/maggner-pelican) is in
advance of a few commits compared to the original one. In fact I add a few
features to the theme:

A menu section to be added in the config file:

    :::text
    MENUITEMS = (
      ('Notes', 'https://www.matthieukeller.com/notes'),
      ('RSS / ATOM feed', 'http://www.matthieukeller.com/blog/feeds/all.atom.xml'),)

A link section (blogroll) as in the main pelican themes, also configurable:

    :::text
    # Blogroll
    LINKS = (('Pelican', 'http://getpelican.com/'),
         ('Python.org', 'http://python.org/'),
         ('Jinja2', 'http://jinja.pocoo.org/'),)

 * In the archives, the date is before the article and its format is like
   '24 May 2015'.
 * The social buttons at the end of an article are now configured in the pelican
   configuration.
 * In the archives the date and the article title are separated with some space.
 * The categories can be display in the menu.
 * The social links are preceded with the corresponding social icon.
 * The archives and feeds links are preceded with a nice icon.
 * The pages CSS will now be the same as the articles one. For instance the
   links in the pages are now in red as there were like the rest of the text
   before.
 * Add a border to each bloc of code.
