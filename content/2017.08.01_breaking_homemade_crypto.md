I recently did a code review assessment on an application for one of my client.
The best part of the application was their own cryptography algorithm.

Moreover, the application was written in PHP and PHP do some strange things with
string, characters and XOR operations.
It only needed a few lines of python in order to break it.

TL;DR : **please do not write your own crypto!**


<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

The cryptography algorithm was a symmetric one, that means there is always a
private key shared between the encryption and the decryption. In fact the
key was shared for the application.

## Encryption algorithm

The encryption algorithm is the following (I rewrote it in python for a better
comprehension):

    :::python
    def crypt(clearText):
        privateKey = '123456'
        cipherText = ''

        key= hashlib.md5(str(randint(0, 32000)).encode('ascii')).hexdigest()

        i = 0
        j = 0
        while (i< len(clearText)):
            if (j == len(key)):
                j=0
            cipherText += key[j]+chr(ord(clearText[i])^ord(key[j]))
            i += 1
            j += 1

        key2 = hashlib.md5(privateKey.encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
        i = 0
        j = 0
        result = ''

        while (i< len(cipherText)):
            if (j == len(key2)):
                j=0
            result += chr(ord(cipherText[i]) ^ ord(key2[j]))
            i+=1
            j+=1

        return result

We observe that there is only XOR operations. Quick reminder about XOR
operations:

    0 XOR 0 = 0
    0 XOR 1 = 1
    1 XOR 0 = 1
    1 XOR 1 = 0

Moreover, by definition: `a XOR b XOR a = b`

## Breaking things

In our situation we need to find `cipherText` in order to find the md5 hash of
the private key. However `cipherText` is build using the clear text and a random
number included between 0 and 32 000. Therefore by a
[Known-plaintext attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack)
we can generate the 32 001 values of `cipherText`, XOR it with the encrypted
string, search for the resulting sting which will be repeating every 36
characters and get the md5 hash of the private key. Our only constrain in that
the plain text must be longer than 36 characters in order to easily find the md5
hash (an other option might have be to search for ascii characters).

Here is the python code:

    def brute():
        clearText='this is a test in order to break some home made crypto'
        codedText=crypt(clearText)
        k=0
        while (k<32001):
            key= hashlib.md5(str(k).encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
            cipherText= ''

            i = 0
            j = 0
            while (i< len(clearText)):
                if (j == len(key)):
                    j=0
                cipherText += key[j]+chr(ord(clearText[i])^ord(key[j]))
                i += 1
                j += 1

            i = 0
            j = 0
            result = ''

            while (i< len(codedText)):
                if (j == len(cipherText)):
                    j=0
                result += chr(ord(codedText[i]) ^ ord(cipherText[j]))
                i+=1
                j+=1
            l = 0
            s = 0
            while (l<32):
                if (result[l]==result[l+32]):
                    s +=1
                l+=1
            if s==32:
                print(k)
                print(result[:32])
                break
            k+=1

I put the two function in a file, added a main and run it:

    [maggick@eridani ~]$ time python crypt.py
    23467
    e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e

    real    0m2.186s
    user    0m2.186s
    sys 0m0.000s
    [maggick@eridani ~]$ echo -en '123456' | md5sum
    e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e  -

We got the md5 hash of the private key. The default key used in the application
was 8 characters long and was use in other algorithms not home made.

## PHP: character XOR character

PHP is doing really funny things, most of you know that.
When analysing the original PHP code of the encryption function, I found
something very strange:

    :::php
    $tmp .= mb_substr($text, $i, 1) ^ mb_substr($key, $j, 1);

How can you make a xor operation between two characters?!

In fact PHP make a xor operation between the ASCII value of the character and
convert the result back to the ASCII character. For instance `'a' xor 'B'` will
result in `65 xor 98` which give `35` therefore `'a' xor 'B' â†’ '#'`

As you may have seen in the above code this is equivalent to the following
python code:

    :::python
    tmp += chr(ord(clearText[i])^ord(key[j]))

## Full code

The complete code is the following:

    :::python
    import hashlib
    import base64
    from random import randint

    def crypt(clearText):
        privateKey = '123456'
        cipherText = ''

        key= hashlib.md5(str(randint(0, 32000)).encode('ascii')).hexdigest()

        i = 0
        j = 0
        while (i< len(clearText)):
            if (j == len(key)):
                j=0
            cipherText += key[j]+chr(ord(clearText[i])^ord(key[j]))
            i += 1
            j += 1

        key2 = hashlib.md5(privateKey.encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
        i = 0
        j = 0
        result = ''

        while (i< len(cipherText)):
            if (j == len(key2)):
                j=0
            result += chr(ord(cipherText[i]) ^ ord(key2[j]))
            i+=1
            j+=1

        return result

    def brute():
        clearText='this is a test in order to break some home made crypto'
        codedText=crypt(clearText)
        k=0
        while (k<32001):
            key= hashlib.md5(str(k).encode('ascii')).hexdigest()
            cipherText= ''

            i = 0
            j = 0
            while (i< len(clearText)):
                if (j == len(key)):
                    j=0
                cipherText += key[j]+chr(ord(clearText[i])^ord(key[j]))
                i += 1
                j += 1


            i = 0
            j = 0
            result = ''

            while (i< len(codedText)):
                if (j == len(cipherText)):
                    j=0
                result += chr(ord(codedText[i]) ^ ord(cipherText[j]))
                i+=1
                j+=1
            l = 0
            s = 0
            while (l<32):
                if (result[l]==result[l+32]):
                    s +=1
                l+=1
            if s==32:
                print(k)
                print(result[:32])
                break
            k+=1


    def main():
        brute()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
