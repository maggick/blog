Since January this blog is automatically build using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The
main advantage is to always use the latest version of [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) as
[travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) always build is environment from scratch. An other
advantage is that I am able to update the site just from my browser for minor
modifications (spell correction for instance).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

Here is the `travis.yml` configuration file pass to [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/):

    language: python

    install:
      # https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/issues/649
      - pip install requests==2.9.1
      - pip install LinkChecker==9.3
      - pip install pelican markdown

      # grab the build theme
      - git clone -b build https://github.com/maggick/maggner-pelican

      # grab the pelican plugins
      - git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins

      # grab the latest published version in order to not erase rss feed
      - git clone https://github.com/maggick/maggick.github.io output

    script:
      - linkchecker --check-extern ./content
      - pelican

    after_success:
      - cd output
      - git add ./
      - git -c user.name="Travis CI for maggick" -c user.email="keller.mdp@gmail.com" commit -m 'Travis update documentation'
      - git push https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/maggick/maggick.github.io.git master


## Declaration

Let us break it a bit. First the declaration part:

    language: python

We do not need the root right so `sudo` is not needed. Moreover we use the
python language.

## install

The installation part:

    install:
      # https://github.com/wummel/linkchecker/issues/649
      - pip install requests==2.9.1
      - pip install LinkChecker==9.3
      - pip install pelican markdown

      # grab the build theme
      - git clone -b build https://github.com/maggick/maggner-pelican

      # grab the pelican plugins
      - git clone https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins

      # grab the latest published version in order to not erase rss feed
      - git clone https://github.com/maggick/maggick.github.io output

We install:
 * [request](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) in version 2.9.1, this is a python library used by pelican
 * [LinkChecker](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LinkChecker) in version 9.3, this is a tool that will check
   that the link in the different articles give a 200 HTTPÂ response
 * [pelican](http://getpelican.com/) which is used to build the site
 * [mardkown](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Markdown) because the articles are wrote in markdown

Then we grab the theme used by the site on the build branch directly on
[github](https://github.com/maggick/maggner-pelican), we also download the [pelican plugins](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins).
We need to get the last build of the site in order to not re publish all the
articles in the RSS feed (it happened once when writing this configuration).

## Script

The script part used [LinkChecker](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/LinkChecker) on the content directory where
are all article in the markdown format. This script will test every link on
every file and exit with an error if a link return something else that an HTTP
200 OK.

Then we use [pelican](http://getpelican.com/) to build the site. If an error happened during
the build the script will also exit with an error.

    script:
      - linkchecker --check-extern ./content
      - pelican

## After success

Finally, after the success of the two script we deploy the site on github pages,

    after_success:
      - cd output
      - git add ./
      - git -c user.name="Travis CI for maggick" -c user.email="keller.mdp@gmail.com" commit -m 'Travis update documentation'
      - git push https://${GH_TOKEN}@github.com/maggick/maggick.github.io.git master

We go in the `output` directory of the build, we add everything for git, we
commit everything using a user crafted for the occasion and my public email
address. The commit message is a generic one. Then we push everything on the
branch `master` of the github pages repository.

For this last step I was forced to give a write access to my repository to
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) using the [github](https://github.com) API. I do not really like
that but as I am monitoring the commit on my own repository I should be able to
detect a hack  or a malicious action of [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The next
step will be to sign all my commit using GPG but I have not find a suitable
solution yet (mostly for commit from browser).
