[Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) provide free and easy SSLÂ certificates. Nevertheless it need to verify that
you own the machine. In order to do that we usually use HTTP verification with
the .well-known directory.

But sometime our servers are not reachable from the internet. Therefore the HTTP
validation is not possible. Hopefully there is another way the [acme](https://letsencrypt.github.io/acme-spec/) challenge can be
validated: [DNS validation](https://letsencrypt.github.io/acme-spec/#rfc.section.7.4).

In this post we will see how we can generate [Let's encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificate for
offline machine with DNS validation for domains hosts by [OVH](https://ovh.com).

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Certificate generation

### Requirements

 * A domain name with its DNS hosted by [OVH](https://ovh.com)
 * curl (sudo apt-get install curl)
 * Python 2 or 3 and pip (sudo apt-get install python-pip)
 * python-ovh (pip install ovh)
 * dehydrated (git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated)
 * OVH hook (git clone https://github.com/antoiner77/letsencrypt.sh-ovh)

### API Key generation

We need API keys in order to use the hook script for the DNS validation. For
that, register the application on [OVH API] (https://eu.api.ovh.com/createApp/ https://eu.api.ovh.com/createApp/).

We get two elements from the website:
* APP_KEY
* APP_SECRET

We need to put them in our `ovh.conf` file in the OVH hook script:

    :::text
    [default]
    ; general configuration: default endpoint
    endpoint=ovh-eu

    [ovh-eu]
    ; configuration specific to 'ovh-eu' endpoint
    application_key=APP_KEY
    application_secret=APP_SECRET
    ; uncomment following line when writing a script application
    ; with a single consumer key.
    ;consumer_key=MA_CLEFS

Now we need to generate the use token in order to validation our keys (you may
need to had execution permissions to the script):

    ./ovhdns.py --init

We get an other link where we need to authenticate one more time. When it is
done just press the `ENTER` key.

The script indicate the user token to insert in the `ovh.conf` file. Be sure to
uncomment the line by deleting the `;` at the beginning of the line.

The configuration file will be needed in the `dehydrated` folder, let's just
create a symlink:

    ln -s /home/user/letsencrypt.sh-ovh/ovh.conf /home/user/dehydrated/ovh.conf

The hook script configuration is finished, now let's configure the `dehydrated`
script.

### dehydrated configuration

In the domains.txt file, indicate the certificates that you want to generate.
Each line will be a certificate but one certificate can be valid for several
domains. For instance, the following configuration will generate two certificates
each for two domains.

    example.org www.example.org
    gitlab.example.com wikimedia.example.com

### Certificates generation

Just launch the dehydrated script (you may need to had execution permission):

    ./dehydrated -c -t dns-01 -k '/home/user/letsencrypt.sh-ovh/ovhdns.py'

 * `-c` (re)generate certificates, will renew them if they expire in less than one month
 * `-t dns-01` use the DNS challenge for acme validation
 * `-k` use specific script for hook

The certificates are stored in `/home/user/dehydrated/certs/`.


## Automatically renew them

In order to automatically renew certificate:

 * Create a symlink in order to use the certificate and the necessary key. This
   is the only moment where we will need root permissions. For
   instance, for the gitlab certificate we need `gitlab.crt` and `gitlab.key`:

    # ln -s /home/user/dehydrated/certs/git.exemple.fr/fullchain.pem /etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.crt
    # ln -s /home/user/dehydrated/certs/git.exemple.fr/privkey.pem /etc/gitlab/ssl/gitlab.key

 * At the following line to the crontab (`crontab -e`):

    0 15 * * * cd /home/user/dehydrated/; ./dehydrated  -c -t dns-01 -k '/home/user/letsencrypt.sh-ovh/ovhdns.py'
