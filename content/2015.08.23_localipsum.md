Localipsum is a simple python program that aim to generate sample text for
developers as the well known [Lorem Ipsum website](http://lipsum.co.uk/). The
main difference is that it used your own dictionaries.
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

I worked on this program at the beginning of the year on the basis of a fun idea:
use my own dictionaries to generate sample text.
This was a quick program to write but the vim's dictionaries were (and still
are) a problem (more on the dedicated section).

I have stop to work on this program as it fulfil my current need.

The program is available on github under public license:
[github.com/maggick/localipsum](http://github.com/maggick/localipsum)

## Usage

The program take in argument a integer and a 'type' of text. The available
'type' of text are:

  * words (--words, -w)
  * sentences (--sentences, -s)
  * paragraphs (--paragraphs, -p)

The integer will indicate how many of this object it should print.

An optional argument (--lorem, -l) will put "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet," at the
beginning of the generated text.

The documentation is display with the --help, -h option:

    :::text
    $ ./localipsum.py -h
    usage: localipsum.py [-h] [--paragraphs] [--sentences] [--words] [--lorem] integer

    Localispum is a simple program providing sample text generating from your own
    dictionaries
    ...

And for instance:

    :::text
    $ ./localipsum.py --sentences 5

    pyramids reintroducing riven cumbersome. Siltstone consider amphibole,
    incident's cherub clam's should carolingian expired abatement charlemagne.

## Dictionaries

The program use the dictionaries from the `./locations` file (one path per
line). Some basic dictionaries are already in it.

### /usr/share/dict/

This directory may contain dictionaries on Unix system, on my own it contain a
dictionary for passwords cracking.

### Firefox

The Firefox dictionaries are located in a file like:
`~/.mozilla/firefox/xxxxxxxx.default/extensions/fr-dicollecte@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org/dictionaries/`
where xxxxxxxx is the identifier of your Firefox profile.

If you have more than one profile each one will have a different name.

### vim

The vim dictionaries are `spl` and `sug` files. The main ones are located in a
path like `/usr/share/vim/vimXX/spell/` where XX is your version of vim (for me
it is 74 right now).

Your personal dictionaries are located in `~/.vim/spell/`.

This files are not directly readable in python. The command `vim -c spelldump`
let you display the current dictionary in a vim buffer. From there it is quit
simple to redirect it to a file. Nevertheless this suppose that vim is install
on the system and the file are not clean and include lots of non word in them.

I choose not to include them in the program for now.

## Technical stuff

The program is written in python 3, it is actually 128 lines written in 29
commits.

It supposes that that the paths are Unix like.
