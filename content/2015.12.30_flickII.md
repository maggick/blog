## Host discovery

Connecting to host-only network:

    sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.1/24 dev vboxnet

Scanning the network to find the virtual machine IP address:

    [maggick@rootine flick-check-dist]$ nmap -sn 192.168.56.1/24

    Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-12-30 18:41 CET
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.1
    Host is up (0.00061s latency).
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101
    Host is up (0.00097s latency).
    Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.45 seconds

Scanning the virtual machine to find open ports:

    [maggick@rootine flick-check-dist]$ nmap -p0-65535 192.168.56.101 -T4

    Starting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2015-12-30 18:50 CET
    Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.101
    Host is up (0.00088s latency).
    Not shown: 65534 filtered ports
    PORT    STATE  SERVICE
    80/tcp  closed http
    443/tcp open   https

    Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 123.28 seconds

## APK analysis

We got an apk. If we unzip it we got lots of xml files and a dex file.

    ls ~/Downloads/flickII/flick-check-dist
    AndroidManifest.xml  classes.dex  META-INF  README  res  resources.arsc

There is a lot of tool in order to decompile and APK and get class files or jar
files like [dare](http://siis.cse.psu.edu/dare/),
[dex2jar](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/) and more ([here is an article
about android decompiler comparaison](http://shgck.io/docs/android/apk_decomp/).

I tried to use dare to convert dex file to java bytecode but there was an issue
between my 64 bits Arch Linux system and the 32 bits executable. I didn't dig
this issue and just go for dex2jar:

    sh d2j-dex2jar.sh flick-check-dist.apk

From there I use [cfr](http://www.benf.org/other/cfr/) to decompile the jar file
to java files and human readable code.

    java -jar cfr_0_110.jar flickII/flick-check-dist-dex2jar.jar --outputdir flickII/flick-check-dist-cfr-java/

We got the decompiled code. The interesting part of the application is the
com.flick.flickeck folder:

    ::text
    ├── com
    │   ├── flick
    │   │   └── flickcheck
    │   │       ├── BuildConfig.java
    │   │       ├── CallApi.java
    │   │       ├── CommandActivity.java
    │   │       ├── DoRegisterActivity.java
    │   │       ├── MainActivity.java
    │   │       ├── PubKeyManager.java
    │   │       ├── ReadApiServerActivity.java
    │   │       ├── RegisterActivity.java
    │   │       └── R.java

We take a look at each file in this directory in order to understand the
application goal and how it works.
