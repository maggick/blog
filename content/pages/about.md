Title: About

I am an IT security consultant. In my daily job I realize intrusion tests on our
clients websites and infrastructure.

I have also work on configuration review, code review and even social
engineering over the phone.

On my free time, I develop for my own purposes and complete security challenges.
You will find more by visiting this website.

I am also trying to make the world a better place by helping people to master
vim in French social events called [Tuppervim](http://tuppervim.org).

## Open Source

I am an Open Source enthusiast. I discover this world in September 2009. My
first GNU/Linux installation was an Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Linx in June 2010. So on
I always have a GNU/Linux distribution installed on my computer or my servers.
Actually my servers run on Debian and my desktops run on Arch Linux.
