Title: About

I am an IT security consultant. In my daily job I realize intrusion tests on our
clients websites and infrastructure.

I have also work on configuration review, code review and even social
engineering over the phone.

On my free time, I develop for my own purposes and complete security challenges.
You will find more by visiting this website.

I am also trying to make a better place by helping people to master vim in
French social events called [Tuppervim](http://tuppervim.org).

## Open Source

I am an Open Source enthusiast. I discover this world in September 2009. My
first GNU/Linux installation was an Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Linx in June 2010. So on
I always have a GNU/Linux distribution installed on my computer or my servers.
Actually my servers run on Debian and my desktops run on Arch Linux.

## maggick

I used maggick as a pseudo. This was given to me by my colleagues at Bearstech
in summer 2012. I used it on irc on github and on some forums.

## Sport

I regularly run and swim. I make myself a ["Palmares" page](/pages/palmares.html)
where I keep track of my races.
