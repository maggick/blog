Title: About

I am a security consultant.

## Open Source

I am an Open Source enthusiast. I discover this world in September 2009. My
first GNU/Linux installation was an Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Linx in June 2010. So on
I always have a GNU/Linux distribution installed on my computer or my servers.
Actually my servers run on Debian and my desktops run on Arch Linux.

## maggick

I used maggick as a pseudo. This was given to me by my colleagues at Bearstech
in summer 2012. I used it on irc on github and on some forums.

## Sport

I regularly run and swim. I make myself a ["Palmares" page](/page/palmares.html)
where I keep track of my races.
