## Clipboard

In order to use the register `+` and `*` with vim the package gvim should be
installed. With neovime the integration of this clipboards is done using
clipboards tools:

* xclip
* xsel (newer alternative to xclip)
* pbcopy/pbpaste (only for Mac OS X)

Therefore if you are unable to use the register `+` and `*` with your new
neovim installation just install one of this tools. See the official
[documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim_clipboard.html#nvim-clipboard)
for more informations.
