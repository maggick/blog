Today I was confronted to the first telephonic scam of my life.

I was in holiday at my mother place when the phone rings. I hear my mother said
"Je ne parle pas anglais" meaning "I do not speak English" therefore I grab the
phone and start talking to the person bothering my mother in English.

This person pretended to be part of Microsoft and that our registred computer
was giving alerts about some malware and hacker in our system. This person
English had a strong Indian color. I asked him were did he gets it french phone
number morover my mother's number (the computer us a MSDNA licence registred at
my name and eventually with my phone number not my mother one). All I get was
that the number was in their "local database" I try to explain to the person
that a local database doesn't mean anything. That is when this person surrender
and give me someone else still working at microsoft.

This new person ask me to go in front of my computer and to type "windows+r"
wich lead to execute and then enter eventwr wich would lead to the system events
log. That is were I stop all of this because it was obviously a scam.

I regret to have cut the communication and I wish that I hade follow the
scenario at its end. Moreover I read a few weeks before on a blog that I follow
that a security profesionnal had fun with this guys by telling them that they
had a problam with their phone and lead them to type the code executing the
phone's factory reset. That seems very funny and I wish I got the idea of doing
it at this time.

Now all I am waiting for is for an other call of this people and to execute this
ideas of following the scenario at its end and then to reset the operator phone.
