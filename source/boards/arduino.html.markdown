# Arduino

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino">Arduino</a> is an open-source board with a microcontroller.
There is a big hacker community around the project.

## Hardware, Boards

### Arduino Uno

This is the first Board I get and it is the simpler and also very small as you can see on the picture bellow.
It comports a <a href="http://www.atmel.com/dyn/products/product_card.asp?PN=ATmega328P">ATmega328p</a> microcontroller.
You can found more informations on the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno">official website</a>.

### Boarduino

Boarduino is my home made board. I realized it at a workshop leaded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman</a> at <a href="http://fabelier.org/">Fabelier</a> a French FabLab in Paris in February 2012.      
We weld each components on the printed circuit board. But the aim of this workshop was to made our own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Be_Gone">TV-B-Gone</a> a device made to shutdown all brands TVs, like an universal remote with just the power button.    
This board is really useful, as you can see on the bellow picture the connectors are under the board and they really fit in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard">breadboard</a> so there is no more cable between the breadboard and the board.
