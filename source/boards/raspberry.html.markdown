# Raspberry Pi

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasberry_pi">Raspberry Pi</a> is a small computer (the size of a credit card). You can found more informations on the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">official website</a>.

## Installation

The raspberry is a real computer so we must install an OS on it.

## Usage

I actually use a raspberry pi as a media center with a Rasbmc on it.
It is very effective !
