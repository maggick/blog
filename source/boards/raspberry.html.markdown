# Raspberry Pi

The [Raspberry Pi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasberry_pi) is a small computer
(the size of a credit card). You can found more informations on the
[official website](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

## Installation

The raspberry is a real computer so we must install an OS on it.

## Usage

I actually use a raspberry pi as a media center with a Rasbmc on it.
It is very effective !
