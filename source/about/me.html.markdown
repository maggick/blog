# About Me

I am a student in French engineering school : <a href="http://www.ensta-paristech.fr">ENSTA-ParisTech</a>. My formation is oriented around "Information Systems". So I am principally doing computer science and software development I also do some computer security.

I am an Open Source enthusiasm. I discover this world in September 2009. My first GNU/Linux installation was an Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Linx in June 2010. So on I always have a GNU/Linux distribution installed on my computer. I actually use a Debian testing.

You can found my resume <a href="http://www.matthieu-keller.info/src/CV/cv.pdf">here in french</a>
