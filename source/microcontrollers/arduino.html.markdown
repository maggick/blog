### Boarduino

Boarduino is my home made board. I realized it at a workshop leaded by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Altman">Mitch Altman</a> at <a href="http://fabelier.org/">Fabelier</a> a French FacLab in Paris in February 2012.      
We weld each components on the printed circuit board. But the aim of this workshop was to made our own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Be_Gone">TV-B-Gone</a> a device made to shutdown all brands TVs, like an universal remote with just the power button.    
This board is really useful, as you can see on the bellow picture the connectors are under the board and they really fit in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard">breadboard</a> so there is no more cable between the breadboard and the board.
