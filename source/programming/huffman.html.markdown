# Huffman

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding">Huffman coding</a> is a compression algorithm
based on pattern repetition and dictionary. This was my first programming project in 2010. It was a school job
for my engineering school, that is why we have some constrains :
* Java as programming languague
* We must write at least one structure (List or Tree)
* We must write an IHM
