# Project Euler

## Presentation

<a href="http://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

Moreover you can found all my source code (most of the time without any comment) on
