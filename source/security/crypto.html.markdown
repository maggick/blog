## RSA

In this school project we have to recode the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_%28algorithm%29">RSA algorithm</a> in C with the <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GMP library</a>.
You can found the source code on <a href="https://github.com/maggick/rsa">GitHub</a>.

## Vigenere Cryptanalysis

In this school project we must code a <a href ="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher#Cryptanalysis">Vigenere cryptanalysis</a> algorithm.
You can found the source code on <a href="https://github.com/maggick/Vigenere-Cryptanalysis">GitHub</a>.
