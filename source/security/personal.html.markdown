# Personal Cryptography 


## KeePassX

<a href="http://www.keepassx.org">KeePassX</a> is a password manager. 
It is a database wherein we can put our logins and associated passwords, this base is encrypted with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twofish">Twofish</a>
using 256 bit key and protected by password and optional "key file".
You can also generate your passwords with a lot of criteria.

## Openvpn

## SSH / Openssh

I use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">ssh</a> to get connected from my traveling computer to my personal computer from all over the world.
This service is really useful but when I consult my connexions logs I see a lot of 
attempt over ssh using wrong login. That is why I choose to just authorize ssh connexion using public key
authentication.
