# SAUC-E

<a href="http://sauc-europe.org/">SAUC-E</a> means Student Autonomous Underwater vehicle Challenge - Europe. 
As its name indicates it is a robotic competition with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auv">AUV Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</a>. 

## SAUC-E '10

I participated to it in 2010 in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Spezia">La Spezia, Italy</a> 
with my engineering school at this moment : the <a href="http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en/">ENSTA-Bretagne</a>.
I just give a hand with the electrical connectors of the robot and shot & edit a 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qtgPdAXAFQ&feature=plcp">short summary video</a>. We finished at the
third place. The following picture show the robot.

## SAUC-E '11

I did not go to the challenge this time but I worked on an algorithm to make the AUV
following a yellow pipeline.
So I write an object following algorithm using 
<a href="http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/motion_analysis_and_object_tracking.html#cv-camshift">camshift</a>
without any considerations for the robot 
(<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d_2A1_NbyA&feature=plcp">see youtube video</a>) and next integrate
the code in the robot. This work fine in my school training pool as you can see on this 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Zy_YwxD2Y&feature=plcp">other youtube video</a>.
You can found the source code on <a href="https://github.com/maggick/imgTracking">github</a>.

The following picture show the robot in the training pool.
