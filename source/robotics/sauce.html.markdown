# SAUC-E

<a href="http://sauc-europe.org/">SAUC-E</a> means Student Autonomous Underwater vehicle Challenge - Europe. 
As its name indicates it is a robotic competition with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auv">AUV Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</a>. I participated to it in 2010 in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Spezia">La Spezia, Italy</a> with my engineering school at this moment : the <a href="http://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/en/">ENSTA-Bretagne</a>.
