# Security

On a server security is really important. bla bla bla

## Ip Tables - Firewall

## ssh

I choose an other port than 22 for my ssh more over I just let on user log in with a sshkey.

## RKHunter

I use RKHunter - which is short for [R]oot[K]itHunter in order to prevent them.
It is a daily cron job at 4am.
