# Security

On a server security is really important.
Some simple change can make a great gain in security.


## Ip Tables - Firewall

It is important to filtre what come in and come out of a server.

## ssh

I choose an other port than 22 for my ssh server.
Moreover I just let one user log in with his sshkey.

## RKHunter

I use RKHunter - which is short for [R]oot[K]itHunter in order to prevent them.
It is a daily cron job at 4am.
