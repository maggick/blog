# Huffman

[Huffman coding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is a compression
algorithm based on pattern repetition and dictionary. This was my first
programming project in 2010. It was a school job for my engineering school,
that is why we have some constrains :

* Java as programming languague
* We must write at least one structure (List or Tree)
* We must write an IHM
