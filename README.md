# Blog

This blog is:
  * publish with [Pelican] (blog.getpelican.com) a static blog generator
  * hosted by [github](github.com) with github pages

I use [ghp-import](github.com/davisp/ghp-import) to publish the content on the
site with the gh-pages branch of the blog project:

  pelican && ghp-import output && git push origin gh-pages
