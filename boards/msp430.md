# MSP430

The [MSP430 launchpad](http://www.ti.com/tool/msp-exp430g2) is a Texas
Instrument product. It is a single board with a
[MSP430](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_MSP430).

It is a tiny card as you can see on the picture bellow. I received it in
July 2011.

## Installation

Installation is really simple:

    # aptitude install gcc-msp430 msp430mcu msp430-libc binutils-msp430
