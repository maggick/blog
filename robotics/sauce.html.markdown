# SAUC-E

[SAUC-E](http://sauc-europe.org/) means Student Autonomous Underwater vehicle
Challenge - Europe. As its name indicates it is a robotic competition with
[AUV, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auv).

## SAUC-E '10

I participated to it in 2010 in [La Spezia,
Italy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Spezia).
We finished at the
third place. The following picture show the robot.

## SAUC-E '11

I did not go to the challenge this time but I worked on an algorithm to make
the AUV following a yellow pipeline.
So I write an object following algorithm using
[camshift](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/cpp/motion_analysis_and_object_tracking.html#cv-camshift)
without any considerations for the robot
([see the youtube
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d_2A1_NbyA&feature=plcp) and next
integrate the code in the robot. This work fine in my school training pool as
you can see on this [other youtube
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Zy_YwxD2Y&feature=plcp).
You can found the source code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/maggick/imgTracking)

The following picture show the robot in the training pool.
